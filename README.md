# BDD

## SPECS

* The program should accept input from the user.
    * Input Example: 1,1,1
    * Output Example: This is an Equilateral triangle
* The program should recognize positive numbers
    * Input Example: -1,1,1
    * Output Example: Please enter positive numbers different from zero only
* The program should return when a trinangle can't be created
   * Input Example: 2,3,7
    * Output Example: This is not a triangle
* The program should return an equilateral triangle is detected
    * Input Example: 2,2,2
    * Output Example: This an equilateral triangle
* The program should return when an isosceles triangle is detected
    * Input Example: 2,2,4
    * Output Example: This is an isosceles
* The  program should return when a scalene triangle is detected 
    * Input Example: 12,13,14
    * Output Example:This is a scalene triangle
### Speculations table

| Behavior  Our program should handle | Input Example |Numerical Example| Output Example |
| :----:   | :-----------: | :------------: | :---------------|
|Accept input from user| Any two side are equal|1, 1, 1|This is an Equilateral triangle   |
|Recognizing positive numbers| Input a negative number|-1, 1, 1|Please enter positive numbers different from zero only|
|A triangle can't be created |No equal sides and sum of two sides is less than third side |2,3,7| This is not a triangle|
|Triangle is equilateral  | All sides are equal|2,2,2|This is an Equilateral triangle|
|Triangle is Isosceles|Two sides are equal | 2, 2, 4|This is an Isosceles triangle| 
|Triangle is Scalene|No sides are equal and sum of two sides is greather than third side|12,12,14|This is a Scalene triangle|
